How to Build bblinux
This file is woefully lacking in information.


In the top-level bblinux directory, try "make help".

Now give these commands:

     $ ./Configure

     $ make getcfg  # select option '1'
     $ make xtools  # go make a ham sandwich; this will take a while
     $ make pkglist # a formality; it would happen as needed
     $ make dload   # get the needed source packages

     $ sudo make pkgs    # may need your password
     or
     $ su -c 'make pkgs' # needs root password

     $ sudo make fsys    # may need your password
     or
     $ su -c 'make fsys' # needs root password

Now look in target/image/ and you will find the magic root file system image.
