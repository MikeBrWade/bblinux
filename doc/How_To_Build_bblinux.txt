0. For the Impatient
====================

Do this:

     $ ./Configure  # one time only is all that is needed!
     $ make getpkg  # probably select 1
     $ make xtools  # one time only per board is all that is needed!
     $ make kernel
     $ make dload
     $ sudo make pkgs
     $ sudo make fsys  # look in target/image/ for the magic burrito

===============
1. Introduction
===============

In the following descriptions there are example commands; they are prefixed by
a shell prompt of "$ ", and comments to shell commands begin with the shell
comment character '#".

===========
2. Licenses
===========

The bblinux make system, documents, and the base file system package are all
licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), a copy of which you can
find in the file doc/COPYING.

The component source packages, in the dload/ directory, are licensed under a
number of different licenses.

========================
3. Building Requirements
========================

To build bblinux you need the build system, which contains this file so you
must already have it, and the individual source packages that need to be stored
in the dload/ directory.

The bblinux build system is hosted in GitHub:

     GitHub repo ...... https://github.com/MikeBrWade/bblinux.git
     Latest Release ... https://github.com/MikeBrWade/bblinux/tarball/master

The build process creates device nodes, sets ownership and privileges for
root-owned files; therefore, you need to be root, uid 0 and guid 0, to run the
parts of the build process.

Software Requirements
---------------------

The following are the software development tools and their versions that are
used to develop and maintain bblinux. Roughly the same versions installed on a
typical Linux distribution ought to work.

     Tool                   Notes

=====================================
4. Build a Cross-compiling Tool Chain
=====================================

You do NOT need to be root to make a cross-compiling tool chain.

bblinux uses a cross-compiler tool set (usually called a cross-tool chain) that
needs to be built. The setup downloads the source packages for Binutils, GCC,
and Linux, then compiles these with your system's compiler to create the
cross-building tool chain.

After 'make getcfg' use 'make x-tools' to build the needed cross-tool chain.

=================
5. Build bblinux
=================

NOTE  For some of the following steps you need to be root, uid and gid both
      need to be 0.

      If you don't want to be root, then the make commands can be prefaced with
      "sudo" or "su -c", where needed; see the examples below.

-----------------------------------
5.1. Setup the bblinux Build System
-----------------------------------

The first thing to do is to run the 'Configure' script at the top-level bblinux
development directory. This needs to be done one time, there is no need to run
the script again. Example:

     $ ./Configure

This will create a file named "bblinux-setenv.sh"; this file must be present
for the bblinux build script to work.

-----------------------------------------
5.2. Selecting the Platform Configuration
-----------------------------------------

The bblinux build system builds bblinux for a given board configuration; the
board is the actual hardware digital system that runs bblinux.

Before building, you select the board configuration with this command:

     $ make getcfg   # No need to be root for this.

You will be given a list of board configurations; select one by typing the
number in the list and then the Enter key.

-------------------------------
5.3. Build the Cross-tool Chain
-------------------------------

Do this ONE TIME after using 'make getcfg'. This will take a while; the
cross-tool chain packages will be downloaded and a cross-tool chain will by
built and put into the x-tools directory. You do not need to do this again for
this board selection; even after using 'make getcfg' to get a different board
selection and then getting this board again, because the cross-tool chain will
still be there in x-tools.

YOU MUST DO THIS 'make xtools' ONE TIME *ONLY* AFTER using 'make getcfg' for
each board for which you want to build bblinux.

     $ make xtools  # Do not do this as root; it will fail if you do. Go make a
                    # ham sandwich; this will take a while

--------------------------------
5.4. Downloading Source Packages
--------------------------------

In the bblinux directory, give this command to download all the required packages for building bblinux for the currently selected board:

     $ make dload   # No need to be root for this.

This makes the package list for this build configuration; see the file
bblinux-pkglst.txt after giving the "make dload" command.

You may already have all the needed source packages. Copy any source packages
to ~/Download and the "make dload" command will get them from there, as a local
cache.

Different bblinux targets have different components, so you need to run
"make dload" at least once for each different bblinux target board you want to
build.

----------------------
5.5. Make the Packages
----------------------

Give one of these make commands:

     $ sudo make pkgs     # May need your password.
     $ su -c 'make pkgs'  # Needs root password.

or in a root terminal window:

     $ make pkgs

--------------------------------
5.6. Build an Individual Package
--------------------------------

An individual package that has a proper config/<package> directory, whether it
is in the package list or not, can be built; the following example builds the
busybox-1.22.1 package.

     $ sudo make PACKAGE=bash-4.2 bash-4.2     # May need your password.
     $ su -c 'make PACKAGE=bash-4.2 bash-4.2'  # Needs root password.

or in a root terminal window:

     $ make PACKAGE=busybox-1.22.1 busybox-1.22.1

This command can be successfully performed ONLY if the bblinux-basefs-1.0 and
bblinux-devfs-1.0 packages have been built AND ALL library dependencies have
been built. This is usefully typically after haven already used "make pkgs".

Any previous build of the package is overwritten. This is handy when
developing and modifying individual packages, particularly those that are not
in the package list.

---------------------------------------------
5.7. Continuing or Resuming Build of Packages
---------------------------------------------

If a package fails to build and you fix the problem, you can continue building
the packages re-starting with the last failed package build; use one of these
commands:

     $ sudo make pkgs_     # May need your password.
     $ su -c 'make pkgs_'  # Needs root password.

or in a root terminal window:

     $ make pkgs_

You can test this command by interrupting the package build process with CTRL-C
and then giving the "make pkgs_" command.

------------------------------------
5.8. Make the Kernel and any Modules
------------------------------------

The kernel source tar file already is in the dload/ directory, it was put there
when the board's cross-tool chain was built with 'make xtools'.  The kernel and
any modules are built with:

     $ make kernel

The kernel will be in the target/kroot/boot/ directory and a package of any
kernel modules will be in the target/kpkgs/ directory.

The kernel configuration file is in the boards/<board>/ directory, probably
named "linux-<version>.config

Setting an environment variable named BB_USE_OLD_BUILD_DIRS like this:

     $ export BB_USE_OLD_BUILD_DIRS=y

This tells the kernel build script to leave the kernel build directory in the
build/bld/ directory and subsequent 'make kernel' commands will re-use that
directory. In this case, since there was no 'make clean' given in the kernel
build directory, if you make no changes to the kernel build configuration file,
then nothing is actually rebuilt.

------------------------------------
5.9. Make the File System Image File
------------------------------------

     $ sudo make fsys     # May need your password.
     $ su -c 'make fsys'  # Needs root password.

or in a root terminal window:

     $ make fsys

The root file system image file will be in the target/image/ directory.

================
6. Build Results
================

Packages
--------

Package build results are in the target/pkgbin/ directory. All packages in this
directory are put into the bblinux file system.

Images
------

The build results are in the target/image/ directory.

sysroot
-------

There is a sysroot directory containing the entire incremental build; the
bblinux packages are constructed by taking some of the files from the sysroot.

The sysroot directory can be used as an NFS root, if you can get your board to
do that.
