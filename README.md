##bblinux

This is the bblinux build system.  It is planned to be a relatively simple build system for a small family of very small Linux systems for several different platforms. This build system is based upon a previous ttylinux build system.

*The bblinux build system is in early development.*

The first bblinux target platform is the Transdend KeyASIC WiFi SD Card (https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Transcend_Wi-Fi_SD_Card_16GB). This build system currently can build the appropriate cross-tool chain and build a working root file system.
