##bblinux

This is the bblinux build system.  It is planned to be a relatively simple build system for very small Linux system, perhaps for several different platforms. This build system is somewhat based upon a previous ttylinux build system.

The bblinux target platform is the Transdend KeyASIC WiFi SD Card (https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Transcend_Wi-Fi_SD_Card_16GB). This build system currently can build the appropriate cross-tool chain, build a working root file system, and build a working kernel.
